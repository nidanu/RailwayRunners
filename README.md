# Railway Runners

This project is about creating a train routing system for intercity trains between specific stations within the Netherlands. This means that within a given time frame, we can establish a number of routes. A route consists of tracks and stations where trains travel back and forth. A route must not exceed the specified time frame. Our objective is to maximize the total score of a route. The score is calculated based on the number of visited stations, the number of routes, and the total time.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

This codebase is entirely written in Python 3.8.10.
The requirements.txt file contains all the necessary packages to successfully run the code. These can be easily installed using pip with the following instruction:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Of via conda:

```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

### Use

An example can be generated by using the following command line prompt:
```
python main.py
```
For style fil in “normal” and choose a number of runs between 0 and 1.000.000.

### Structure 

The following list describes the most important folders and where to find them.

- **/Code**: Contains all code used in this project.
- **/Classes**: Contains two classes used in this case
