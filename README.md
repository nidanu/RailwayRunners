# Railway Runners

This project is about creating a train routing system for intercity trains between specific stations within the Netherlands. This means that within a given time frame, we can establish a number of routes. A route consists of tracks and stations where trains travel back and forth. A route must not exceed the specified time frame. Our objective is to maximize the total score of a route. The score is calculated based on the number of visited stations, the number of routes, and the total time.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

This codebase is entirely written in Python 3.8.10.
The requirements.txt file contains all the necessary packages to successfully run the code. These can be easily installed using pip with the following instruction:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Of via conda:

```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

### Use

An example can be generated by using the following command line prompt:
```
python main.py
```
First pick an algorithm from the list displayed. Keep in mind that most algorithms will require at least an hour to complete 1,000,000 runs or more.
The results of the runs will be saved in a text file located at **/Results** even if you stop the program prematurely.


### Structure 

The following list describes the most important folders and where to find them.

- **/Code**: Contains all code used in this project.
- **/Classes**: Contains two classes used in this case

## Statistics
We randomly drew 1.000 observations from each of the algorithms. Based on the Shapiro-Wilk test, the data did not meet the assumption of normality, W = 0.9558, p < .001. Based on the Levene test, the data also did not meet the assumption of homogeneity of variance, F(2, 2997) = 361.43, p < .001. Therefore, a Kruskal-Wallis test was performed. The algorithms differed significantly in score, H(2) = 1993.2, p < .001. Post-hoc  Tukey tests showed that the greedy algorithm performed superior to both the normal algorithm (p < .001) and the maximum algorithm (p< .001). Thus we conclude the greedy algorithm to be the most effective.
